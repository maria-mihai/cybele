    <p ><span>Cybele</span> is an online shop for a fictional house plants company.
      It is a personal project over the summer break, whose purpose was to help me learn more about <span>React</span>.
      The images, botanical names and descriptions were all brought over from <a href="https://houseplantshop.com/">this website</a>.
      Moreover, I built this project by closely following Zero To Mastery's Udemy course. After learning the principles, I set out my own objectives and worked on implementing those.
      For any suggestions, please contact me <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-teodora-mihai/'><span>here</span></a>.</p>
